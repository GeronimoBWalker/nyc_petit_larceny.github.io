          In New York City, <strong>petit larceny</strong> includes minor theft offenses such as shoplifting and 
          stealing unattended items. The plot above shows the yearly total of petit larceny incidents with the 
          2023 totals from each borough along the right side. 
          <br>
          <br> 
            This project explores trends in petit larceny across the 
            city’s five boroughs—Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, the Bronx, and Staten Island—from 
            2010 to 2023. Using visualizations, it compares larceny rates alongside a handful of 
            economic indicators from census data to highlight patterns and disparities.
          <br>
          <br>
            <strong>All data used in this project consists of yearly totals.</strong>

            Manhattan and the Bronx are closely connected, as are Queens and Brooklyn, while Staten Island 
            sits more isolated. These geographic relationships help frame the borough-level trends we’ll explore.
        </p>

        
        <h2>Yearly Household Income by Borough</h2>
        <p>
            By normalizing the data within each borough, we can see the percentage of households in each of the 
            five income groups from 2010 to 2023.
        </p>
        <div class="image-container">

        </div>
        <p>
            In all five boroughs, the upper and middle classes have steadily expanded over time, with the most 
            dramatic upper-class growth in Manhattan. As of 2023, 69% of households in the Bronx fall into poor, 
            poverty, and extreme poverty categories — a significantly higher proportion than in any other borough, 
            highlighting a persistent economic disparity.
        </p>
        
       
       
        <img src="ny_images/historical/unemployment_rate.png" alt="unemployment_rate" style="max-width: 400px; height: auto; display: block; margin: 0 auto;">
         <p>
            In 2023, Manhattan and the Bronx were the only boroughs with unemployment rates above the citywide 
            average—highlighting ongoing labor market challenges in both areas.
            <br>
            <br>
            Now that we’ve explored some of NYC’s economic context, let’s take another look at how petit larceny 
            incidents are distributed across the boroughs.
        </p>
        
        
        

        <h2>Petit Larceny Incident Distribution</h2>
        <p>
          These boxplots show the yearly distribution of total petit larceny incidents in each borough from 2010 to 2023.

        </p>
        <img src="ny_images/historical/boxplot_numpeople.png" alt="boxplot_totals" class="responsive">
        <p>
            Looking at the shape of each distribution, Manhattan has been the most prone to spikes in incidents, while Staten Island shows a much narrower range.
            All five boroughs, however, experienced a post-pandemic surge, reaching new highs in 2022 and 2023.
            <br>
            <br>
            Now, let’s adjust for population size to better understand where petit larceny incidents are more or less concentrated. 
        </p>

        <img src="ny_images/historical/boxplot_percapita.png" alt="boxplot_percapita" class="responsive">
        <p>
            When we look at incidents per capita, the distribution shifts—placing the Bronx just behind Manhattan, 
            and bringing Queens much closer to the smaller population of Staten Island. Interestingly, the two 
            boroughs with the highest per capita incident rates also had the highest unemployment rate in 2023.
        </p>

        <p>
          Next, we’ll explore broader trends in census-based economic data.
          By applying <strong>min-max scaling</strong> within each 
          borough, we can visually examine how these metrics have changed over time. 
          <br>
          <br>
            Keep in mind the <strong>data represents yearly total number of incidents or the 
            yearly total number of people in each economic category</strong>.

        <h2>Petit Larceny Incidents</h2>
        <p>
          After applying min-max normalization, larger areas represent years with higher totals, 
          while smaller areas reflect lower values. This makes it easier to spot relative highs 
          and lows within each borough over time.
        </p>
        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="ny_images/historical/scaled_petit_larceny_incidents.png" alt="scaled_incidents" class="time">
        </div>
        <p>
            Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, and the Bronx saw their highest incident counts in 2022, 
            while Staten Island peaked in 2023. Staten Island also showed elevated totals in 2014 
            and 2013, with levels in 2014 nearly matching those of 2022. Additionally, the Bronx 
            experienced a noticeable rise in 2019.
    
        
        <h2>Unemployed</h2>
        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="ny_images/historical/unemployed.png" class="time">
        </div>
        <p>
          Unemployment steadily declined across NYC from 2010, hitting a citywide low in 2019.
          However, by late 2020 rates began to surge—peaking in 2021 at levels not seen since 2011.
          A decade of progress was quickly erased, though conditions began to stabilize by 2022. 
          <strong>A year before petit larceny incidents peaked, the number of unemployed people 
            also peaked</strong>.  
        </p>
      
        
        <h2>Armed Forces</h2>
        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="ny_images/historical/armed_forces.png" class="time">
        </div>
        <p>
            The number of people working in the Armed Forces steadily declined from 2010 until a 
            citywide spike in 2022, bringing levels back in line with those seen a decade earlier.
            <strong>
                A notable spike in petit larceny incidents occurred at the same time, mirroring 
                the rise in Armed Forces employment.
            </strong>
        </p>
 
        
        <h2>Information</h2>
        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="ny_images/historical/information.png" class="time">
        </div>
        <p>
            The information sector remained relatively stable from 2012 to 2021.
            In 2021, Manhattan hit a timeline low, while numbers also declined in Queens and the Bronx.
            By 2022, the sector peaked citywide—yet dropped to new lows in the Bronx and Staten Island 
            the following year.
            <strong>This citywide expansion coincided with the spike in petit larceny incidents.</strong>
        </p>
       
        
        <h2>Wholesale Trade</h2>
        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="ny_images/historical/wholesale_trade.png" class="time">
        </div>
        <p>
            Wholesale Trade employment declined in 2021, with Staten Island hitting an all-time low.
            While the other four boroughs continued to decline, Staten Island saw a notable rebound in 2022.
            <strong>This decline in wholesale trade jobs coincided with the spike in petit larceny incidents.</strong>
        </p>


        <h2>Manufacturing</h2>
        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="ny_images/historical/manufacturing.png" class="time">
        </div>
        <p>
            Manufacturing jobs steadily declined across NYC starting in 2012.
            By 2021, Staten Island maintained relatively higher employment, 
            while the other boroughs reached lows—a trend that continued until an expansion in 2023.
            <strong>These lows in manufacturing employment coincided with peaks in petit larceny incidents.</strong> 
        </p>
        

        <h2>Natural Resources, Construction, Maintenance</h2>
        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="ny_images/historical/natural_resources.png" class="time">
        </div>
        <p>
            Employment in Natural Resources, Construction, and Maintenance remained relatively stable with minor fluctuations until a sharp decline in 2020.
            By 2021, all boroughs saw significant job losses, followed by only a modest rebound later years.
            <strong>Yet another instance of job loss aligning with peaks in petit larceny incidents.</strong>
        </p>
        
        
        <h2>Agriculture, Forestry, Fishing, Hunting, and Mining</h2>
        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="ny_images/historical/agriculture.png" class="time">
        </div>
        <p>
            The combined agriculture, forestry, fishing, hunting, and mining industries showed varying peaks 
            across time and boroughs. <strong>Manhattan saw its highest levels in 2022</strong>, but overall, these occupations 
            don’t exhibit a clear or consistent trend across the city.
        </p>
        
        
        <h2>Arts, Entertainment, Recreation, Accommodation, Food Services</h2>
        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="ny_images/historical/arts.png" class="time">
        </div>
        <p>
            From 2010 to 2014, arts, entertainment, recreation, accommodation, and food services steadily grew, 
            stabilizing through 2020. By the end of 2020, the sector saw a sharp decline across all 
            boroughs—except Staten Island, where levels remained steady.
            Recovery began after 2021, though the Bronx experienced the slowest rebound.
            <strong>These industries declined a year before petit larceny incidents peaked.</strong>
        </p>
        

        <h2>Worked From Home</h2>
        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="ny_images/historical/worked_from_home.png" class="time">
        </div>
        <p>
            From 2010 to 2020, working from home remained relatively uncommon across all boroughs.
            In 2021, it surged to a timeline high citywide, followed by a slight decline in 2022 and 
            2023—though rates remained elevated.
            <strong>Remote work peaked one year before petit larceny rates spiked.</strong>
        </p>

        <p>
            As remote work surged, we’d expect fewer people commuting. 
            Let’s explore how different modes of travel changed over time.
        </p>
        
        

        <h2>Walked</h2>
        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="ny_images/historical/walked.png" class="time">
        </div>
        <p>
            In 2021, the number of people walking to work hit its lowest levels in Manhattan and 
            the Bronx. While most boroughs saw a steady rebound in foot traffic, Queens continued 
            to decline, reaching its lowest point.
        </p>
        

        <h2>Public Transportation</h2>
        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="ny_images/historical/public_transportation.png" class="time">
        </div>
        <p>
            After a decade of steady use, public transportation dropped sharply across all five boroughs in 2021, 
            followed by a gradual rebound in the years that followed.  
        </p>
        

        <h2>Drive Alone to Work</h2>
        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="ny_images/historical/drove_alone.png" class="time">
        </div>
        <p>
            Solo driving to work spiked in 2017, declined through 2020, and hit a low in 2021 before 
            stabilizing again in 2022. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Overall, commuting dropped sharply in 2021 and rebounded by 2022—coinciding with the 
            spike in petit larceny incidents. <strong>The rise in theft may reflect more people 
            returning to public life.</strong> 
        </p>


        <h2 style="color:beige">Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
            This exploratory analysis examined trends in petit larceny incidents across New York City’s 
            five boroughs from 2010 to 2023, alongside key economic and labor indicators. The visualizations 
            revealed potential connections between economic instability, employment shifts, commuting 
            patterns, and spikes in theft. Notably, boroughs with higher unemployment and economic 
            hardship—like the Bronx and Manhattan—tended to experience higher rates of petit larceny, 
            especially in the years following the COVID-19 pandemic. These patterns suggest that broader 
            socioeconomic conditions may play a meaningful role in shaping crime trends.
        </p>


         <h2 style="color:beige">Next Steps</h2>
         <p>
            To deepen the analysis, future work could explore neighborhood-level data, incorporate 
            variables like police activity or income inequality, and apply statistical or machine 
            learning models to assess causality. Incorporating qualitative data or city planning 
            insights could also help contextualize the trends observed. As new data becomes available, 
            especially post-2023, this framework can continue to inform urban safety and policy 
            discussions.
